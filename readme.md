# Complex Neural Networks
The purpose of this repo is build neural networks that take complex valued data, e.g. RF signal/digital communications, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and process the data using complex operations. 


This code uses the complex tensor built William Falcon. Be careful to read his description of the tensor and what operations are supported. The readme is under **pytorch_complex_tensor**.

# TO RUN
```python
cd notebooks
jupyter lab complex_convolution.ipynb
```
This notebook creates a convolutional layer tbat operates on complex tensors.
